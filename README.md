### I'm Janet (she/her)...
a UK-Irish dual national and career changer from the control industry, studying part-time for a Diploma in **Full Stack Software Development**. I have completed all three **Code First Girls** (CFG) courses in **Web Development, Python & Apps, Data & SQL**. Recently, I studied **Cloud Computing and Data Analytics** with the **Institute of Coding** at Edge Hill University in the UK. Once a month, I can be found co-organising pair-programming workshops for the underrepresented in tech at **codebar** in Birmingham's city centre. Every so often, you may also find me talking about codebar & CFG at **Brum.js** and **TechMids**! ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on my Github profile page with the help of **Eddie Jaoude's** course *How to Customise your GitHub Profile*
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning how to build full stack web applications with **Python** and **Anvil**
