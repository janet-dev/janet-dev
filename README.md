### I'm Janet (she/her)...
a UK-Irish dual national and career changer from the control industry, studying part-time for a Diploma (L5) in **Web Application Development** with **[EKC DigitalLearn](https://www.ekcgroup.ac.uk/ekc-digitallearn/computing/web-application-development-diploma-level-5)** at **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/)**.

Once a month, I can be found co-organising pair-programming workshops for the underrepresented in tech at **[codebar](https://codebar.io/)** in Birmingham's city centre. Every so often, you may also find me talking about codebar & CFG at **[Brum.js](https://twitter.com/brumjs)** and **[TechMids](https://twitter.com/techmids)**! ðŸ˜„
